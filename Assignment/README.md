# Linux System Architecture 

## What does kernel mean ?

A kernel is the core part of an operating system. It acts as a bridge between software applications and the hardware of a computer. The kernel manages system resources, such as the CPU, memory, and devices, ensuring everything works together smoothly and efficiently. It handles tasks like running programs, accessing files, and connecting to devices like printers and keyboards.

## What does Operating System mean?

Operating System lies in the category of system software. It basically manages all the resources of the computer. An operating system acts as an interface between the software and different parts of the computer or the computer hardware. The operating system is designed in such a way that it can manage the overall resources and operations of the computer. 

Operating System is a fully integrated set of specialized programs that handle all the operations of the computer. It controls and monitors the execution of all other programs that reside in the computer, which also includes application programs and other system software of the computer. Examples of Operating Systems are Windows, Linux, Mac OS, etc.

An Operating System (OS) is a collection of software that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. The operating system is the most important type of system software in a computer system.

## Is Linux a Kernel or an Operating System?

Technically, Linux is a monolithic kernel, not an operating system. The correct term is- Linux distribution or Distro, such as – Ubuntu, Fedora Linux, Deepin, etc. 
and Conclusion:

Now you know what to answer when someone asks you if Linux is a kernel or an operating system. However, if someone says, “Linux is my favorite operating system.”, you don’t have to correct them by telling them this story. The GNU and Debian projects use the name “GNU/Linux”, but most people simply like to call it “Linux” to refer to the combination. So, there is nothing wrong with it, but if you want to be technically correct then use the term “Linux Distribution“.

## What is an Architecture Layer Diagram ?

The Linux architecture can be depicted as a layered structure. Starting from the bottom, these layers are hardware, kernel, shell, and applications.
